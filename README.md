# MetaImpact v1.0.0 Beta

An online web-application to design a future study that will have an impact on the current evidence base. Furthermore, MetaImpact helps educate users about meta-analysis, it's assumptions, and features of future study design using information boxes and novel plots.

First version will only have frequentist functionality.

<ins> Current bugs </ins>

We are aware of the following problems with MetaImpact. There are also further features and improvements planned that can be viewed in the 'Issues' section of this repo.
* There are two 'bugs' with drawing the significance contours/regions (issue #5):
  * The contours can appear to suddenly 'drop' to the bottom of the plot at the far edges.
  * A white triangle can appear where it shouldn't be.
* The help wizard for the 'power' calcular has some bugs (issue #6):
  * The help button doesn't sit inside the box
  * The 'type of impact' help section goes to the top left of the screen, rather than highlighting the option.
